title: Things I wish I'd known when I started using Flutter

Recently, I've been playing around in Flutter as a way to make iOS apps. I hate
basically everything about Apple's iOS development environment, especially
Swift, XCode, Apple's documentation. For me, using frameworks has been much
easier than trying to write native iOS code. Having tried a lot of them at this
point, Flutter seems like the current best option. However, there are definitely
some things I wish I had known when I started using Flutter. <br />

## Objects are cheap and composability is key

When I first started playing around in Flutter, I was always confused by how few
properties individual widgets have. Compared to CSS for example, there wasn't a
way to define things like padding or borders in most widgets.

What I eventually realized is that Flutter just has a very different model.
Conceptually, objects are intended to be cheap in Flutter and the primary way to
build a UI is through composing widgets together. So you don't need to feel bad
wrapping that widget in an `Expanded` wrapped in a `Column` wrapped in a
`Padding`! <br />

## Most UI components don't store any state

Most (all?) built-in UI components in Flutter don't store any state. For
example, the `Checkbox` widget doesn't store a checked/unchecked value. The
`TextField` widget doesn't store the current text in the field. There's a couple
interesting things that come from this:

1. This is why the various controller classes for widgets (like
   `TextEditingController`) exist. The widgets themselves don't store any state
   so Flutter provides the controller classes to do that. You can also choose to
   store the state yourself.
1. You _must_ redraw widgets when their state changes. In most UI frameworks
   that I have used, a checkbox has a "checked" value and if you click the
   checkbox, it toggles visually. In Flutter, clicking a checkbox does nothing
   by default. You have to implement the `onChanged` handler and have that cause
   a redraw by updating your application state. This one took me a while to wrap
   my head around. <br />

## Simple state management is usually best

[There][state-1] [are][state-2] [a][state-3] [lot][state-4] of libraries for
state management in Flutter. After trying a lot of different options, I believe
that really simple state management is the best option for most cases. What does
this mean? There's a couple built-in classes that will handle 99% of your state
management needs: [ValueNotifier][vn]/[ChangeNotifier][cn] and
[ValueListenableBuilder][vlb]/ [ListenableBuilder][lb].

At a high level, I do the following for widgets with state:

1. Extend `StatefulWidget`
1. Have your `State<T>` class either implement/mixin `ChangeNotifier` or expose
   some `ValueNotifiers`.
1. Wrap the widgets that consume that state in `ValueListenableBuilder` or
   `ListenableBuilder`.

I like this because it allows me to be as granular as I want, either by defining
a bunch of small `ValueNotifiers` or having the whole state class extend
`ChangeNotifier`. It does the same thing on the widget builder side, where you
can wrap your entire widget in `ListenableBuilder` or just individual UI
elements. <br />

## Don't use the Cupertino library

This is just my opinion but I would recommend against using the Cupertino
library. I'm mostly aiming to make iPhone apps so my first instinct was to use
the Cupertino library to match the iOS look and feel. Unfortunately, the library
isn't very fleshed out. There's a lot of functionality you would expect that is
available in the Material library but not the Cupertino one.

I recommend using Material or some kind of third-party UI components.
