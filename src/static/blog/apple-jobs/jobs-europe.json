Despite operating at a massive scale, we consistently meet Apple's high expectations by delivering timely and secure notifications in over 35 languages to customers in more than 150 countries.\n\nThanks to Apple's unique integration of hardware, software, and services, engineers here partner to get behind a single unified vision. That vision always includes a deep commitment to strengthening Apple's privacy policy, one of Apple's core values. Although services are a bigger part of Apple's business than ever before, these teams remain small, forward-thinking, and cross-functional, offering greater exposure to the array of opportunities here.\n\nCulturally we believe in a close partnership with our development teams and aim to design and build new services together. We're passionate about software and automation in SRE and develop a variety of tooling and infrastructure. Our services run on mixed platforms - many run on our bare metal fleet which you will help transition to new Kubernetes micro services and work with state of the art observability tools and monitoring platforms.",

LLDB\u2019s unique strength is its powerful expression evaluator that is backed by the actual compiler to JIT expressions typed by the developer into the debugged process and execute them. This flexibility allows LLDB to be used even in contexts outside of traditional debugging: For example, it is also the technology powering the Swift REPL.\n",
